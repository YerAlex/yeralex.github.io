      <description>&lt;p&gt;In small and medium-sized enterprises, there is a common phenomenon, that is, managers do not have a precise understanding of their company&amp;rsquo;s financial situation, so their perceptions of the actual business situation as if it were like a layer of fog covered eyes, they do not know how much money they earned, do not know how much money they owed or how much money others owed themselves in exact numbers, only a roughly estimated amount. There is no doubt that this is a long-term development problem of the enterprise that must be resolved, however, small and medium-sized enterprises are faced with the pressure of survival and trivialities, to solve this problem is not all “willingness” problem, after all, quite a lot of cases is “can and can not” problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
